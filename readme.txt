ROgre 
Version 1.0.0 "Demo Release"

Description:
    ROgre pays homage to the legendary game of Rogue. In ROgre, the player 
    descends further and further into the depths of a dungeon, fighting
    enemies and collecting loot.

    The player collects randomly generated loot (contained in chests and 
    dropped by monsters) to increase their score. Every second that passes
    while the player is alive adds to this score.

    Everything is random in ROgre, which increases the replayability of this
    and other roguelike games tremendously. Monsters have randomly generated 
    names and randomly drop randomly generated items. Randomly placed chests
    contain a random number of randomly generated items. This all takes place
    in a randomly generated world.

    Everything the player does is remembered. When the player is finished 
    playing, they can save their progress and come back at any point in the
    future. When their hero dies, their death is remembered in the graveyard
    where they and their friends can see information about their death.

    Everything is customizeable. When creating a new game, the player can
    make the game as easy or as difficult as they wish. They can enter
    a custom seed into the random generator in order to play other worlds
    or their past worlds in which they were defeated.

    Everything is modifiable. Monster names and items can be modified via
    text files in the data/ folder to customize gameplay further.
